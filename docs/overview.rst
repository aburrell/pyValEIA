Overview
========

pyValEIA is a package designed to identify the Equatorial Ionization Anomaly
(EIA) in plasma density data. It will then validate these features for model
results. Currently, support is provided for the identificaiton of EIA morphology
in in situ satellite data and ground-based VTEC maps. An interface to PyIRI is
provided as a convenient base-line model to compare against your own model
performance.
